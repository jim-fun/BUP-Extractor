# BUP Extractor
Unpack quarantined files from McAfee AV

McAfee VirusScan 8.7/8.8 packs and XORs malware to prevent the system from being re-infected and being re-detected by future AV scans. This tool is built using Python and extracts the malware into a folder with the information about the detection.
